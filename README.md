NYCOpenData Week 2021 workshop notebook used to teach the audience an introduction to data visualizations in Python using NYC OpenData. 

This workshop will serve as an introduction to visualizations in Python using data from NYC OpenData. Specifically, we will utilize the fire incident dispatch dataset to explores different plotting libraries in Python. We will also be exploring trends of fire incident types throughout the five boroughs, as well as response-time trends that is measured in seconds. For the purposes of this workshop, the dataset used was filtered to include only responses for the year 2018 and include only fire-related incident types.
